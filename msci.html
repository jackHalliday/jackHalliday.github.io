        <h1>Experimental investigation of radiatively driven plasma flows</h1>
    </header>
        
	<p>In this project we'll be investigating plasma flows which are 
	driven by the X-Ray burst from an imploding wire-array Z-Pinch. These 
	plasma flows are fast (V ~ 40 km/s); hot (T ~ 2e5 K); and dense 
	(n ~ 1e24 /m^3). They expand into strong magnetic fields (B ~ 10 T), 
	which are driven by the current flowing through the Z-pinch. A 
	self-emission image of a typical experiment is shown below. </p>

	<p>This is an experimental configuration which is highly relevant to 
	applications in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and laboratory 
	astrophysics. Our focus in the project will likely be on the laboratory 
	astrophysics side, however if you have a strong interest in ICF then there
	is some flexibility here. Laboratory astrophysics involves creating small
	scale plasma flows which can be scaled up to predict the behaviour of some
	astrophysical object. This is an extension of the process which is used 
	in aeronautics to scale between small models of aircraft in wind tunnels 
	to the real thing.
	</p>
	
	<p>The project will involve experimental work on the 
	<a href=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/plasma-physics/magpie/>MAGPIE pulsed 
	power generator.</a> This is a unique experimental facility housed in the 
	basement of the Blackett building which is capable of producing mega-ampere
	current pulses over ~ 100 ns timescales. The conditions of the plasmas in
	the experiments we perform will be measured using a variety of state-of-the
	art diagnostic techniques including laser-interferometry; time-gated
	self-emission imaging; and Thomson scattering. During the project you will
	gain experience working with these diagnostics and be guided through the
	process of analysing experimental data.</p>
	
	<p>If your ability to work in the lab is disrupted by COVID at any point 
	during the year, then we are in a position to accommodate this however the
	focus will necessarily pivot from hands-on work to data analysis. 
	</p>
	
	<p>The project will be supervised by
	<a href=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.lebedev>Sergey Lebedev</a> and
	<a href=https://jackhalliday.github.io/>Jack Halliday.</a> If you're an
	Imperial physics MSci student and this proposal interests you, please email
	<a href="mailto:jack.halliday12@imperial.ac.uk">jack.halliday12@imperial.ac.uk</a>
	to discuss further.</p>
